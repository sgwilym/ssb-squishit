A microclient for SSB that visualises the relationships between you, the authors you follow and the authors that follow you â€” and the relationships between them (phew).

Queries a locally running instance of [ssb-patchql](https://github.com/sunrise-choir/ssb-patchql), which you will need to set up for this to work.

To run:

`yarn && yarn start`
